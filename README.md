It is a simple shopping list fullstack app with ADD & DELETE items functonality.

*I made this app being inspired by [Traversy Media's video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yTazHkDR4o&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE&index=3&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) and, to be honest, adopted some of the steps from it in order to wrap my head around the MERN stack.*

## How to use the code

In a few words,
1. Copy the repo and add a `.env` file with `MONGO_USERNAME` and `MONGO_PASSWORD` variables set to MongoDB username and password for your db cluster.
2. Run `npm i` for both root repo and `client` repo, hence there are two `package.json` files - for frontend (`client`) and backend.
3. To start a front and back dev servers at the same time run `npm run dev`.
